**Late Spring**
It's been several relatively quiet weeks since **Detachment: Leo** arrived in Evergreen and made their presence felt. They discovered and elimiated the sniper **Psalm** who seems to belong to an unknown organization **HUC**. They then were dispatched by **Patience** to a disturbance out by **Liu Maze** and rescused **The Chaus** from a horde of wayard subalterns and mechs which seemed to be remotely controlled.

**Detachment: Leo** spent those weeks integrating into the colony.
- **Voodoo** began work on better training the Militia with **Brava Hadura** and they're already showing improvement. He also started a concerted salvage operation in an effort to fortify supplies and equipment the colony might use in it's defense.
- **EXO** took some time to get to know the lay of the colony and now has a much better understanding of the layout. He's **Streetwise**. He also assisted **Voodoo** in his salvage operation.
- **Hound** attempted to ingratiate himself with **Patience**. He was moderatly successful and call call on **Patience** for assistance, but now owes them a favor after the current mission is complete. He also did some scouting and tracking, and will be able to get some advance information about a fight during the coming mission.
- **Hunk** took the time to get focused on his engineering and inventive side. He also started work on a signal tracking device. He should be able to finish it once he finds a better equipped workshop and a little mentoring by someone with better knowledge of Hercynia's particular atmospheric noise.

Now the colony is on high alert, as skirmishes have again picked up at Evergreen's extreme border. **Paitence** called a meeting with **Detachment: Leo**, **Edina Ji**, **Brava Hadura** and some of her officers. **Edina and Brava** went over their reports and initial impressions and accolades of **Detachment: Leo**, then **Patience** gave their report.
Since the monsoon season is starting to wane, **Patience** is now able to retask a weather satellite for limited recon duty. It's limited to static image capture suring fly-overs, and can't handle real-time transmission, but it's a start. **Hound** asked for this information to be made available to **Detachment: Leo**, which of course was agreed upon. **Patience** asked the team to stay local for the next several days with tensions growing on the borders.

After turning in for the night, **Detachment: Leo** was ripped from their sleep (or work, in **Hunk's** case) by explosions and emergency klaxons. The colony is under fire. Time to go to work...

The attack came switfly and with a lot of energy. Frames that looked similar in sytle and loadout to **Venom** began a siege of the colony. **Detachment: Leo** made of their frames and engaged the enemy along the eastern edge of **Evergreen**. **Hunk** stalked right down the middle with shields up with **Hound** on his 6. **Voodoo**flanked south, and **Exo** planted behind the palasades to take some long ranged shots. Enemy artilary started to immediately pummel the defenses, but **Exo** put a solid slug right into the chest plate of the **Bombard**, which survived only due to it's *Siege Armor*. **Archers and Striders** made up the rest of the enemy force, who fanned out in an effort to pin down and take **Detachment: Leo** apart. **Hound and Hunk** were particular tagets of interest running down the center of the field of fire. **Voodoo** engaged with his *Krakatoa Flame Thrower* and melted an **Archer** and a **Strider**. **Hound's** turret drones were again MVPs helping to ginish off the second strider, and **Hunk** annihilated the last **Archer**. **Exo** took a second shot at the **Bombard** and blew a hole clean through it, ending the engagement.

As that **Bombard** fell, the fighting elsewhere around the wall quickly dies down as the enemies disengaged and melteed back into the treeline. As that happened **Patience** send a priority message to **Detachment: Leo**: The **Stable Reactor** installation is under attack and needs immediate backup. A large *(size 4)* constructin hauler driven by **Josiah Wells**  was put into service to give **Detachment: Leo** a ride down river to the reactors to lend emergency assistance to the besieged militia there. Hopefully they'll arrive in time.
