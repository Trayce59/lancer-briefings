# Landmark Colonial (LC) Transport Carrier // 2.21.5014u
After receiving a sparse briefing from Union, and a slughtly better one from The Company, **Team Leo** is eady to land on **HERCYNIA** to begin assessing the situation on the ground.

The remote shuttle is to drop the team off, refuel, and return to the carrier, which will be back in one standard year to retrive **Team Leo**.

# Hercynia, Early Spring.
**Team Leo** met with a militia squad, including their commander **BRAVA HADURA**. She let the team know that **"The Bugs"** are good shots and they should get down and get the shuttle in the air. Once in town, **The Sniper** took a shot at the team and certainly got their attention. 

During their initial meeting with **Patience** and **Edena Ji**, **Team Leo** had a choice to make. Protect the Engineers draining the Landing Bowl, or hunt the sniper that's been plaguing the colony. After some brief deliberation, they decided to hunt the Sniper. 

After sending the specs for their chassis to the Print Shop, they went to **The Bottom of the Well** for some food, drink and relaxation while they waited for their chassis. Here they met **Clair** the bartender. **EXO** tried to have a conversation with **PVT. ELI “BEEBLE” BENETTON** but it didn't go so well. **PVT. NOVEM** introduced himself and that conversation went much better. He let them know that most of the Militia is not well trained and only has been needing to carry weapons actively for about 14 months, when the raids began.
