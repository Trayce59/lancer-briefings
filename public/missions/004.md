# Mission // 004
## Rallying Cry

**Detachment: LEO** has opted to travel to **Hivehome** after finding **Dthall Ordo**. She doesn't believe **Evergreen** or **Hivehome** will survive without the other. Now that she's convinced **Evergreen** isn't working with **the Machine** and all the blood has been shed over a misunderstanding, she's more convinced than ever that uniting the disparate communities and making amends is the only possibly way to victory.

# Goals
Attempt to convince the **HUC** city-states to rally under one banner, come to the aid of **Evergreen** and continue the war against **the Machine**.

# Stakes
If the HUC is not convinced to aid Evergreen, the Hercynians won’t come to Evergreen’s aid in the future without some extra effort.

# Reserves
-None
